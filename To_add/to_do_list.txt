To do: 

1. Add help menu

2. Add "put" (item) "in" (container)

3. Add "visible"/"invisible" attribute? Or, for containers, see-through or not see-through?
    -- If an item is inside a container that's locked, you can't see items inside
    -- If something is covering(??) something else, you can't see what's underneath(??)
        -- adding "move" verb would conflict with current move function, so you'd need to figure that out

4. Improve the whats_inside function

5. Consider adding locked/unlocked doors??

6. Add eating?

7. separate parser file into appropriate # of game files

For the future (aka complicated):
#. Add money/trade?

#. Add customizable player details 
    -- Player name
    -- Player pronouns

#. Add NPCs
    -- NPCs can give quests

#. Enemies/combat
    -- Add combat
    -- Add enemies (which have loot when they die?)
