To do: 

1. Re-do action system. 
    -- No being told every turn what actions are available. Make some sort of command to list available actions. 
    -- Longer list of action commands (i, I --> i, I, inventory)

2. Re-do how finding gold works.
    -- Not tied to map tile, if possible. 

3. Add personal information for player
    -- Player name
    -- Player pronouns
